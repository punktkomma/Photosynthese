## Overview

**Photosynthesis II** is an immersive and interactive **sound-based video game experience**, created as the final project at the **Kunsthochschule Kassel**.  
The work explores the intersection of **sound, space, and perception**, situating the player in a reality that oscillates between clarity and disorientation.

While the codebase might appear erratic — even feverish — this intensity reflects the project’s conceptual core: an artistic process that embraces both chaos and structure, vulnerability and control.

> _The game is in German._

## Concept

The project originates from a simple yet unsettling space:  
a **doctor’s waiting room** — a sterile environment where time seems to stand still.

It does not seek escapism, but rather a confrontation with feelings of **helplessness and powerlessness** that emerge when human needs collide with rigid systems.  
The act of waiting — this enforced passivity — becomes both the setting and the subject of the experience.

Through an evolving **soundscape** and subtle interactivity, the player is drawn into **dreamlike (and sometimes traumatic) worlds**.  
These sonic spaces may appear as a refuge from reality, yet ultimately reveal themselves as mirrors of the very condition one attempts to escape.

## Technical Notes

- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.3 
- **Language:** German (Interface and narration)  
- **Platform:** OSX  
- **Audio:** Original field recordings and electronic compositions  
- **Code:** Intentionally idiosyncratic – the structure mirrors the emotional (un)logic of the creator rather than formal programming conventions.

While the code can appear irrational or opaque, it embodies the **psychological fragmentation** central to me.
